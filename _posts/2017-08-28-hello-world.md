I've just set up this whole page using GitHub pages, a helpful Jekyll template (forked from a fork of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/)), and a domain purchased on NameCheap (which has worked fabulously so far). Only cost me $40 all up for four years!

I plan to use this to post musings about the way the data science field is moving, insights I've gathered over the last few months working in the tech startup industry, and a few things I've discovered in Sydney which are worth noting.
