I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) at the Johns Hopkins University working with [Ilya Shpitser](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ilyas/). 

I'm interested in applying causal inference to solving problems in healthcare. These problems include:
* Causal identification
* Missing data (where the mechanism of missingness is not at random) 
* Applications of causal inference and machine learning to electronic health record data

I've been working on a Python package for causal inference! Check out [ananke](https://ananke.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.

In a previous life, I was a data scientist at [Hivery](https://www.hivery.com), a machine learning startup in the retail space. I completed my undergraduate degree in statistics under the supervision of [Anton Westveld](https://westveld-statsci.com/) at the Australian National University.
