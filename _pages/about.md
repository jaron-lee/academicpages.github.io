I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) at the Johns Hopkins University working with [Ilya Shpitser](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ilyas/). 

I'm interested in applying causal inference to solving problems in healthcare. These problems include:
* Causal identification
* Missing data (where the mechanism of missingness is not at random) 
* Applications of causal inference and machine learning to electronic health record data

I completed my undergraduate degree in statistics under the supervision of [Anton Westveld](https://westveld-statsci.com/) at the Australian National University.
